DSF
===

Delta Sigma forecasting tools for LSST DESC galaxy-galaxy lensing analyses.

DSF is a modelling package for projected galaxy-galaxy lensing observables,
with a focus on :math:`\Delta\Sigma` data vectors, covariance ingredients,
tomography choices, and LSST DESC forecasting workflows.

The package is currently in early development. Interfaces, examples, and
recommended workflows may change as the codebase is expanded and validated.

What DSF does
-------------

DSF is designed to connect the main ingredients needed for
:math:`\Delta\Sigma` forecasting:

- tomographic lens and source samples,
- :math:`\Delta\Sigma` data-vector modelling,
- galaxy-matter covariance construction,
- forecast-ready inputs for Fisher or DALI analyses.

The intended workflow is:

.. code-block:: text

   tomography → data vector → covariance → forecast inputs

In practice, this means DSF helps users build matched lens-source bin
combinations, compute stacked :math:`\Delta\Sigma` observables, construct
covariance ingredients, and prepare forecast inputs for downstream inference
or forecasting tools.

Where to go next
----------------

The API reference documents the main DSF modules currently available. More
installation notes and worked examples will be added as the package matures.
